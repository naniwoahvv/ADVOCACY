                <strong>National Museum of Fine Arts</strong><br><br>
                The National Museum of Fine Arts in the Philippines is a museum that features hundreds of 
                different mediums of art made by Filipinos such as paintings, sculptures, lace art, and sketches. 
                Some of these pieces date back as far as World War 2. Most of the subjects in these pieces are 
                reflections of events that took place during the time of its making and religious art.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even works of art from centuries past should be preserved because they accurately capture the culture, 
                society, and historical events of the time they were created. In the context of the Philippines, 
                the paintings and sculptures remind us of the struggles endured by our ancestors and the causes 
                for which our national heroes battled.

                <h2>Personal reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    Visiting the museum was an exciting experience for me as an art enthusiast. The sculptures were particularly 
                    fascinating, especially given their age and preservation. Smaller pieces were better maintained compared to the larger, 
                    life-sized ones. The freedom of expression in the sculptures, including depictions of nude women, stood out as a reflection
                     of the artists' creativity. This freedom serves as inspiration for modern artists to push boundaries and create art that 
                     reflects themselves or the current events, leaving a legacy for future generations.

                    <strong>Gallery 8: BATAAN</strong><br><br>
                    Gallery 8 at the Philippine National Museum of Fine Arts is a
                    noteworthy gallery featuring artworks depicting the atrocities in Bataan. Despite being graphic, it resonated with me as a viewer because it 
                    depicted the events that took place when the pieces were made. Given the background, it evokes a different
                    kind of admiration and empathy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It may be hard for some people to understand or appreciate the artwork. Despite that, these preservations 
                    spark curiosity amongst Filipino youth regarding our culture- some of which may have not been discussed in 
                    classroom settings.
